         The query interacts directly with the filesystem to resolve parts of the query, in addition to using the Spotlight metadata index.
         
         Normally, metadata queries rely heavily on their pre-built index for speed. However, the index might not always be perfectly synchronized with the live state of the file system (e.g., immediately after a file change).
         
         Using this option permits the query to go "live" to the file system to verify information or gather attributes that might be missing or potentially stale in the index.
         
         - Note: Consulting the live file system is significantly slower than querying the optimized Spotlight index. Therefore, using this option will almost always result in considerably slower query performance. It should generally be avoided unless there's a very specific need for this behavior and the performance impact is acceptable.
